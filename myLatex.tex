\LARGE{\textbf{Introduction to how Brick Braker is typically played :}}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [\bullet] \textbf{Objective :} The main objective of Brick Breaker is to clear all the bricks from the screen.
    \item[\bullet] \textbf{Paddle Control: } Players control a paddle that moves horizontally along the bottom of the screen. The paddle is used to bounce the ball back up towards the bricks.
    \item [\bullet] \textbf{Ball and Bricks:}  A ball is launched from the paddle, and it bounces off the walls and bricks. When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears.
    \item [\bullet] \textbf{Game Over :}The game is typically over if the ball falls below the paddle and off the screen. 
    \item[\bullet] \textbf{Scoring: } Players earn points for breaking bricks.

    \LARGE \underline{\textbf{PROJECT OVERVIEW }}    
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Language used: } Java
    \item \textbf{Libraries used: }
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For GUI Framework - Swing and AWT(Abstract window toolkit)
        \item  For Events  -  awt.Event\\
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Classes: }
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [\bullet] \textbf{Jframe : } It provides a window in which you can add various GUI components and controls.The methods of Jframe class :
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1]\ setBounds(): It is used to set the position and 
           dimensions of a JFrame. location (x, y) and size (width, height) of the frame 
        \item[2]\ setTitle() :  Sets the title of the frame.
        \item[3]\ setResizable(): Determines whether the frame can be 
          resized by the user.
        \item[4]\ setVisible(): Sets the visibility of the frame. Setting it to true makes the frame visible, and setting it to false hides the frame.
        \item[5]\ setDefaultCloseOperation(): Defines what happens when the 
             user closes the frame. 
        \item[6]\ add(): Adds a component (e.g., JPanel, JButton, JLabel) to the frame.
        \end{enumerate}
     \item [\bullet] \textbf {Color} :The Color class in the Java Swing library is used to represent and manipulate colors in graphical user interfaces .Methods are as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item[1]\ setColor(): it sets of color of background or of any shape.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item [\bullet] \textbf{Font} :is used to specify the font family, style, and size for rendering text in graphical user interfaces. Methods are as follows.
        \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1]\ setFont() : to set the font of text.
         \end{enumerate}
      \item [\bullet] \textbf {Graphics} : The Graphics class in the Java AWT  library is used for drawing and rendering graphics on various graphical components and surfaces in a Java application.
       \begin{enumerate}
          \item[1]\ fillRect(): Fills a rectangle.
          \item[2]\ fillOval() : Fills an oval.
          \item[3]\ drawString() :Renders text at the specified position.
          \item[4]\ dispose() : Releases any system resources used by the Graphics object when finished with it.
          \item[5]\ paint(Graphics g) : You can use the Graphics object provided as a parameter to draw shapes, text, and images on the component.
          \end{enumerate}
     \item[\bullet] \textbf{Graphics2D} :Graphics2D extends the graphics class which focuses on geometry and color managment.
     \item[\bullet] \textbf{Rectangle} : It is a fundamental class for defining and manipulating rectangles in graphical applications. 
          \begin{enumerate}
        \item[1]\ Rectangle(int x, int y, int width, int height): Creates a Rectangle object with the specified position (x, y) and dimensions (width and height).
        \item[2]\ Rectangle.intersects : whether two rectangles will intersect or not.
        \end{enumerate}
      \item[\bullet]\textbf{Action Event }: The ActionEvent class in Java is part of the java.awt.event package.The ActionEvent class is primarily used to respond to user actions and invoke appropriate event handlers. 
    \item[\bullet]\textbf{Action listener interfaces}:These interfaces provide a mechanism for responding to user actions.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[1]\ actionPerformed() : action performed method is called to perform an action.
         \end{enumerate}
         
      \item[\bullet]\textbf{Key Event }:The KeyEvent's object  contains information about the event, such as the key character and modifier keys.
        \item[1]\ getKeyCode() : Returns the integer keyCode associated with the key in this event.
      \item[\bullet]\textbf{Key Listener Interfaces} : It is commonly used to capture and respond to key presses and key releases. 
       \begin{enumerate}
         \item[1]\ keyPressed(KeyEvent e):This method is called when a key is pressed down. It is triggered as soon as the key is pressed and held.
     \item[\bullet]\textbf{Timer} : generate periodic events or actions.
              \begin{enumerate}
      \item[1]\ start() :Starts the Timer, causing it to start sending action events to its listeners.
         \end{enumerate}
     \item[\bullet]\textbf{JPanel} : JPanel provides a blank canvas, or a region within a GUI, where you can add other Swing components, draw custom graphics, or organize and group other components. 
     \item[\bullet]\textbf{BasicStrokes}:  is used to define the basic characteristics of the strokes used for drawing lines and shapes.
     \item[\bullet]\textbf{MapGenerator } :It generates the layout of bricks.
     \item[\bullet]\textbf{MyGame }: IT is the main class of the game which implements the features of Jframe class and load all the classes.
